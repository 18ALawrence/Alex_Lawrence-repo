# Alex Lawrence 
## Studying cybersecurity and digital forensics undergraduate at Leeds Beckett

My current modules are digital forensics, programming in python and computer communications

### Digital forensics
The module digital forensics is focused on identifying the data, preserving the integrity of the data, alysing it and being able to present the data. We learn about techniques such a hasing using MD5 or SHA-1 and using physical or software write blockers. We are also taught about the laws we must follow and the ACPO Principles

### Programming 
The programming module focusses on Python and other essenrials to programming. Such as using learning how to use markdown, Git and GitHub for version control, which helps maintain project history, provide backups and is key for creating a CV specifically for programming. 

### Computer Communications
The Comouter Communications module gives a base understaning of how networks operate by learning about the TCP/IP model and layered architechture, including the OSI model. It helps me gain essential knowledge of how protocols work togther and communicate. Developing knowledge on error detection, flow control and recovery mechansisms. The module delves deeper into specific protocols such as HTTPS and DNS with core trannsport concepts like TCP. Practical skills are developed through lab sessions in which we use Wireshark, to analyse network behaviour.
